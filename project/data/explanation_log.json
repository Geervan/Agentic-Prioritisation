  "1": "Login is a fundamental and critical user flow, essential for accessing any part of the application, and could be impacted by underlying API changes.",
  "2": "This test failed previously and directly relates to user input validation, a process often reliant on API calls that could be impacted by the error handling refactor.",
  "4": "Profile updates involve crucial data persistence via API calls, making it highly susceptible to the refactor of API client error handling, even though it passed previously.",
  "5": "This test failed previously and its core functionality, autocomplete, is heavily reliant on rapid API interactions, making it highly vulnerable to the API client changes.",
  "3": "While important, dashboard navigation passed previously and is less likely to be directly affected by API client error handling unless specific navigation points rely on volatile API data.",
  "6": "This test passed previously and checks a static link, which is very unlikely to be impacted by changes to API client error handling or retry logic."
